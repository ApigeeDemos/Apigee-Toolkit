# Apigee-Toolkit

The Apigee Toolkit is a collection of strategies, tools, training resources, checklists that are working with other Apigee customers. It's meant to be generic. It's not the only way to do it, but it gives you a starting point if you need one. The purpose of the toolkit is to.

- Ensure consistent information and strategies are used on customer engagements.
- Create content that can be used to train customers.
- Reduce time to make decisions.
- Help customers mature their Center of Excellence using proven strategies.

“Apigee Basics” - If I have 10 minutes to refresh my memory on a subject this is where I’ll go. The decks can also be used to train customers, or reused to make new decks. 

“Advanced Topics” - Proven strategies for those topics that come up occasionally. API versioning, unit testing, static code analysis, etc… It’s not the only way to do it, but this is a good starting point if a customer has nothing. 

“Technical Resources” - Any links that are deemed handy to hand to the customer as needed. They need not be Apigee resources exclusively. Can include online editors, standards, source code examples, etc. 

“Training/How-To” - Just that. Something to hand to customers to prepare (Think checklist) for engagement or easy to share links on a variety of topics.

“Checklists” - To ensure the customer is ready and we are as well a few checklists to use at specific points in the engagement to gauge customer readiness and to identify training needs either prior to or during an engagement.  

If you want to contribute but don’t want to deal with taxonomy or format you can drop the items into the “Contribution Bucket” at the root folder. Please be sure to remove any customer names before sharing.
